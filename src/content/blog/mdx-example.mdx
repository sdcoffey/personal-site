MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      language: "js",
      filename:"example.js",
      code: `
const x = 1;

class Vert extends Component {
}
`
    },
    {
      language: "rb",
      filename:"example.rb",
      code: `
x = 1
`
    }
    ]} />


<figure>
  <Image
    src={steve}
    alt="Photo of Steve"
    format="webp"
    quality="med"
    class="h-64"
  />
  <figcaption>some caption</figcaption>
</figure>

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.
