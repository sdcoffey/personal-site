MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

<Image
  src={steve}
  alt="Photo of Steve"
  format="webp"
  quality="med"
  class="h-48 w-full rounded object-cover object-center"
/>

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
  Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
