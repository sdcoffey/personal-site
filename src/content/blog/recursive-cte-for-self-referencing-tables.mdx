Have you ever dealt with a data structure that looked like this?

<CodeBlock tabs={["recursive-ctes/employee.ts"]} />

This data structure is _self-referencing_. That is, it may reference others of its own
type, if, for example, we need to reference an Employee's manager or find one of their direct
reports.

I use Typescript above for simplicity of type definitions, but because data storage
mostly happens in the database in production environments (I hope), let's translate this
into the definition of a table. We'll use Postgres-flavored SQL for this exercise, these same concepts
will translate into roughly equivalent MySQL or SQLite.

<CodeBlock tabs={["recursive-ctes/create-employees.sql"]} />

Great! So what do you do if you need to find the name and title of someone's skip-level manager (i.e. your manager's manager)?
Wrong answers first!

<CodeBlock tabs={["recursive-ctes/find-skip-level.ts"]} />

Why is this a wrong answer? Well, besides the pseudo-database code, it is also a perfect
example of an **N+1** query. That is, a querying pattern where you make one initial query,
and one additional query for every item of some iterator that you need to gather data on.

N+1 queries are bad becuase, in general, it takes more time to go back and forth from the database,
with the wire time, serialization and deserialization, than the database spends actually performing your
query. It would be _much better_ to do this as one query.

## Recursive CTEs

Recursive CTEs (**C**ommon **T**able **E**xpressions) are a simple way to traverse self-referencing data
with ease.

<details>
  <summary>Wait, what's a CTE?</summary>
  Common Table Expressions help you write cleaner, more expressive queries by allowing you to construct one or
  more psuedo-tables in the scope of the query, that you can select from later. Here's an example:

  <CodeBlock tabs={["recursive-ctes/cte-example.sql", "recursive-ctes/cte-example-ddl.sql"]} />
</details>

So what would the SQL look like to replace our code above?

<CodeBlock tabs={["recursive-ctes/find-skip-level.sql"]} />
