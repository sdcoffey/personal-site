I recently concluded a two-year journey into startup world. Having spent 8 years at bigger companies, it was my first
time going off the deep end into my own thing, freed from the corporate shackles that govern life at companies of a certain
size.

Spoiler: we were not successful in creating something that enough people found valuable to justify continued effort,
and after two years, we decided at the end of July to close down shop. Despite that,
we built some cool, if niche, products, and I personally learned a ton. Coming away from the experience, I can say that
it was certainly the highest-density period of learning in my life, and well worth the time spent.

It was late 2021, VC money was flowing like never before. Markets were at their all-time high and pictures of blasé
monkeys were selling for six figures. The Gamestop bubble was only several months in the rearview mirror. We were in the
era of the retail investor.

In September of that year I joined a team of two close colleagues from Sonder to build an app to fill what seemed an obvious need at the time:
help investors keep track of their assets. For retail investors and young professionals in our circle: one of a few things would be true:

1. You had investable income.
1. You had multiple investment accounts between 401ks, funny-money Robinhood accounts, "serious" accounts, crypto,
and alternative assets (employee stock options, bonds, etc.).
1. You had never received any training (formal or informal) on how to best manage these assets.

Enter AssetClass: an easy-to-use app that tracks all of your investment accounts in one place and makes smart recommendations
to help you get the most out of your savings.
