## It's time to give up the bundler!

I recently stopped bundling my JS in my Rails setup, and opted for a more straightforward approach leveraging **ES Modules** and **importmaps**
to load and run Javascript in the browser. I'm convinced this is the way to go, and I wanted to write a brief explainer on ESM + importmaps and why you
should think about ditching the bundler in your next project.

In this post, I want to cover briefly what ES Modules are, what they can replace, the historical reasons why we've used bundlers in the past, and why
continuing to do so might be hurting your page performance.

## What are Javascript Modules?

Broadly, a JS module is a way of lexically scoping code to be made selectively available in another module.
Concretely, it's just a file that declares exports to be available in another file.

There are two main module systems:

- **CommonJS** (which you'll be familiar with if you've ever written Javascript for Node)
- **ES Modules** (now supported in the browser and used in Deno)

Here's the same module written for both CJS and ESM:

```js
// module.cjs
const merge = require("lodash").merge;

function addPi(target) {
  return merge(target, { pi: 3.14 });
}

module.exports = addPi;
```

In this example, when this module is loaded, Node would go looking for `lodash` in our `node_modules/` folder, and make your function, `addPi`, available as a default export to any other modules requiring it.

```js
// module.mjs
import { merge } from "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21";

export default function addPi(target) {
  return merge(target, { pi: 3.14 });
}
```

Here, we're able to specify that `lodash` should be imported from a remote URL, in this case the CDN esm.sh.

### Browser support
CommonJS modules have **never been supported in the browser**, while ESM is now supported by Node<Footnote text="ES Modules are supported by Node, but some things, like remote loading demonstrated here, do not work out of the box."/>
the vast majority of browsers<Footnote text="Can I use ESM?" href="https://caniuse.com/?search=ESM"/>, and alternative JS runtimes like [Deno](https://deno.land) and [Bun](https://bun.sh).

## What's an importmap?

Importmaps are a way to tell the browser where to find Javascript (specifically, **ES Modules**) that are included via an `import` from another module.

You might have spotted the immediate problem with the ES Module above, which is one of **dependency management**.

Generally, when you're using outside code, you want to do two things:

1. Use **specific versions** of your dependencies, so that your code is **deterministic**.
1. Use the **same version** of that dependency everywhere in your code that it's used.

Without one source of truth for specifying dependency versions, your module resolutions could be scattered across dozens or even hundreds of files! Imagine the headache of updating any of them.

Importmaps are a way to solve both of these problems, by predeclaring where modules should be resolved from, and (if you're using a good CDN), which version is resolved.
In this way, you can think of an importmap for the browser as serving the same function that `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files serve for in Node/CommonJS contexts.

Here's the same script above rewritten for the browser, using importmaps.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
  <script type="importmap">
    {
      "imports": {
        "lodash": "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21"
      }
    }
  </script>
  <script type="module" src="/module.mjs"></script>
</head>
```

```js
// module.mjs
import { merge } from "lodash";

export default function addPi(target) {
  return merge(target, { pi: 3.14 });
}
```

<details>
    <summary>What's going on here?</summary>

    In our html doc, we've declared two script tags, one with `type="importmap"`, and one with `type="module"`.
    When the browser parses the second script tag, it will download and execute `module.mjs`.

    As it begins to parse `module.mjs`, the first statement the interpreter will come across is an import of the `merge` function from `lodash`.
    Because `lodash` is not an absolute or relative import, it will refer to the importmap to resolve the module.

    Having resolved `lodash` to `https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21`, it will fetch the module, and continue executing `module.mjs`.
</details>

### Browser support
Importmaps are supported by only 85%<Footnote text="Can I use import maps?" href="https://caniuse.com/import-maps"/> of browsers, but there's [a nice polyfill](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims)
that you can use to bump that up into the 90s if you care to do so.

## Why were we bundling again?

In my estimation there are three historical reasons, and two modern reasons for why we bundle our Javascript.

<Aside>
  <h2 slot="header">Wait--what's bundling?</h2>

  <slot>
    Tools like Webpack and Rollup take your Javascript and all of its dependencies (like React or lodash), as well as
    normalized references to external assets (like images) and squish them into one big file, called a "bundle".
  </slot>
</Aside>

### Historical reason 1: the global namespace

Before we started bundling code, we loaded all of our own code as well as external dependencies via script tags.
The problem is that all non-ESM Javascript loaded in the browser is loaded into the global namespace.
Commonly, library authors would attach themselves to the global namespace under a
name they hoped was unique enough not to conflict with your code or other libraries.

You might be old enough to remember writing some code like this:

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.slim.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="my-div"></div>

  <script>
    var myDiv = $("#my-div");
  </script>
</body>
```

Where is `$` coming from? Well, it's declared in `jquery-3.7.0.slim.min.js`, and available everywhere thereafter.

<details>
    <summary>I'm not old enough to remember this...</summary>

    Good for you.

    Above, we're importing jQuery by adding a script tag to the `head` of our html pointing at the jQuery CDN.
    When the browser encounters this tag, it fetches the jQuery source from the CDN, and loads it all into the global namespace.

    jQuery cleverly exposes all of it's functionality through the global operator `$`, so that it's functions don't collide with any of yours,
    or any from other libraries you might be importing.

</details>

You yourself had to be careful to not shadow any variable or function names between your own files, or risk unpredictable behavior.
In this world, organizing code into multiple files and trying to avoid naming collisions and issues with hoisting is a really bad time.

Bundlers help solve this problem in two ways:

1. Allowing you to resolve dependencies in one place, your `package.json` file.
1. Enabling the use of CommonJS-style imports between files or dependencies, making it easier to reason about the dependency graph and lexically scope your code.

Bundlers do this by rewriting all of your code and your dependencies to be independently namespaced,
then replacing calls to `require` or `import` with new functions that reference other parts of the bundle.

<details>
    <summary>Show me</summary>

    Imagine this very complex code that we want to run in the browser:

```js
// math.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

module.exports = { add, subtract };
```

```js
// module.js
const { add, subtract } = require("./math");

console.log(add(1, 2));
console.log(subtract(1, 2));
```

Unfortunately, this code is **not** going to run in the browser as is, since, as we've established, CommonJS modules are not supported by any browser. Let's run it through esbuild and see what we get.

```js
// esbuild --bundle module.js
(() => {
  var __getOwnPropNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames;
  var __commonJS = (cb, mod) =>
    function __require() {
      return mod || (0, cb[__getOwnPropNames(cb)[0]])((mod = { exports: {} }).exports, mod), mod.exports;
    };

  // math.js
  var require_math = __commonJS({
    "math.js"(exports, module) {
      function add2(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }
      function subtract2(a, b) {
        return a - b;
      }
      module.exports = { add: add2, subtract: subtract2 };
    },
  });

  // module.js
  var { add, subtract } = require_math();
  console.log(add(1, 2));
  console.log(subtract(1, 2));
})();
```

    There's obviously a lot going on there, but the key thing to note is that all of our code is now in one file,
    and our `require` statement has been replaced with a call to a new function, `require_math` that loads our code from what was previously the standalone file `math.js`.

    All of the code is wrapped in an IIFE (**Immediately Invoked Function Expression**, pronounced "iffy") which keeps any of this code from leaking into the global namespace.

</details>

### Historical reason 2: HTTP/1.x

In ancient times (pre-2015), browsers supported only the first major version of the HTTP protocol.
Without getting too into the weeds on the nuances of HTTP, suffice it to say that in HTTP/1.x,
the relationship between requests and the underlying TCP connection is 1:1. That is, only one resource may be loaded for each TCP connection.

If you're using TLS, two roundtrips are required to perform a TLS handshake before any HTTP bytes can be transferred.
Then, when the request is finished, you have to close this connection and start fresh on the next request.

</figure>

<Aside>
  <h2 slot="header">TLS 1.3</h2>
  <slot>
    Before I get any neckbeards in my DMs letting me know that fewer roundtrips are required to perform a handshake with TLS 1.3, let me say:
    while that is true, TLS 1.3 wasn't released until 2018, well after many websites were already using HTTP/2.
  </slot>
</Aside>

Modern websites (even in 2015) have lots of images and custom fonts and other resources external to the HTML.
Because HTTP/1.x forces the browser to close the underlying connection after every HTTP request, you incur **2x more server
roundtrips for every additional resource.**

Bundling Javascript was a convenient way to reduce the number of requests needed to fetch all of your scripts.
Since all your Javascript is now squished into one big file, you've eliminated potentially dozens of server roundtrips.

#### HTTP/2

With HTTP/2, browsers may _re-use_ TCP connections to the same host, and servers on the other end may even eagerly push resources to the client before they're requested, greatly increasing pageload performance.

HTTP/2 is now supported by 96%<Footnote href="https://caniuse.com/?search=http%2F2" text="Can I use HTTP/2?" /> of browsers, and we even have [HTTP/3](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/) on the way.

### Historical reason 3: ES6 support

Until several years ago, not all browsers supported ES6 features we know and rely on, like classes, arrow functions, the `const` keyword, and too many others to name.
These features are incredible, and make writing Javascript 100x more pleasant. But because ES6 support was slow to roll out, some transpilation of ES6 was required to ensure
your code would work in browsers that did not yet support ES6. This ES**X** → ES5 transpilation was and remains one of the jobs of the bundler.

Today, 96%<Footnote href="https://caniuse.com/?search=es6" text="Can I use ES6?" /> of browsers support ES6 features natively without the need for transpilation.

### Modern reason 1: Assets

Depending on what your stack looks like, you might need to reference external assets, like images, from your JS. This is also one of the jobs of the bundler.
Let's look at a React example:

```jsx
// react.jsx
import plus from "./plus.svg";

export default function Counter() {
  return (
    <button>
      <img src={plus} />
    </button>
  );
}
```

When we run this through esbuild, we get the following output, with the svg inlined directly into the bundle as a URL string.

```js
// esbuild --bundle --loader:.svg=dataurl --jsx=automatic react.jsx

var plus_default =
  'data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" class="w-5 h-5">%0A  <path d="M10.75 6.75a.75.75 0 00-1.5 0v2.5h-2.5a.75.75 0 000 1.5h2.5v2.5a.75.75 0 001.5 0v-2.5h2.5a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-2.5v-2.5z" />%0A</svg>%0A';

// react.jsx
var import_jsx_runtime = __toESM(require_jsx_runtime());
function Counter() {
  return /* @__PURE__ */ (0, import_jsx_runtime.jsx)("button", {
    children: /* @__PURE__ */ (0, import_jsx_runtime.jsx)("img", {
      src: plus_default,
    }),
  });
}
```

### Modern reason 2: JSX

If you're old enough to recognize my jQuery example above, you're probably also old enough to remember that HTML wasn't always a regular fixture in our client-side JS.
React popularized the concept of HTML-in-JS (known as JSX), and is largely responsible for making it a mainstream part of our dev toolkit.

It's worth noting that my `react.jsx` example above won't run in the browser as is. JSX is not a supported part of the JS spec, the interpreter won't know what to do with all those angle brackets.
When we transpile that code, the transpiler is ripping out all of that HTML and replacing it with a call to a library function.

Here are the relevant sections again for clarity:

```jsx
// react.jsx
return (
  <button>
    <img src={plus} />
  </button>
);
```

Is transpiled into:

```js
return /* @__PURE__ */ (0, import_jsx_runtime.jsx)("button", {
  children: /* @__PURE__ */ (0, import_jsx_runtime.jsx)("img", {
    src: plus_default,
  }),
});
```

<details>
  <summary>What's `import_jsx_runtime.jsx`?</summary>

Depending on what specific JSX-focused framework you're using, your transpiler will use some library function to
create or update a DOM element from your JSX tree.

In this example `import_jsx_runtime.jsx` points to React's `jsx-runtime` package. You might also remember `React.createElement` from older versions of React, or
simply `h` in Preact.

</details>

<br />

<Aside>
  <h2 slot="header">Transpilation vs Bundling</h2>

  <slot>
    I think it is easy to conflate the two concepts, as I have above, but I do want to be clear about the difference between _transpilation_ and _bundling_.

    **Bundling**, again, is simply the process of concatenating JS code from distinct files into one, larger bundle, and inlining external assets into the same.

    **Transpiling** is the process of transforming your code into **semantically identical but syntactically different** code.

    Transpilation might occur because you're using ES6 features but are targeting browsers that only support ES5, or in this case, because
    you want to use JSX instead of writing `React.createElement` everywhere.
  </slot>
</Aside>

Before I get a howler about having conflated transpilation and bundling in this example, I want to argue that in 2023, many devs
would find the distinction to have little difference, as they are rarely used independently. The extent to which the relationship between transpiling and bundling has been conjoined in the JS zeitgeist I think is attributable to the wild popularity of tools like Webpack and Vite,
which serve transparently as both transpiler and bundler.

Later, we'll cover my preferred setup, using esbuild to **transpile only**, which allows us to use these great client-side
frameworks without bundling, and get a lot of free pageload performance as a result.

## Bundling can be a performance detractor

As we've covered, I think there are many good historical reasons why we've bundled our JS in the past, but I think there are some pretty
strong reasons to stop bundling JS code.

As we covered [above](#historical-reason-2-http1x), with the advent of HTTP/2, serving multiple assets from the same server is much more efficient than it used to be.
Unless you're serving literally hundreds of JS files to your client, it's probably not worth bundling them together. We get a huge bump in pageload performance for free just by using HTTP/2
to efficiently serve resources over one TCP connection.

There are actually some explicit performance benefits to be gained by serving individual ES Modules, the first being:

### Cacheability

Browsers aggressively cache assets from pages you visit. If you've ever cleared your browser cache, you know that it can balloon in size, often into the gigabytes.

So what is all this stuff? It's CSS, JS, images, fonts, and a host of other assets that webpages use to display rich content. The browser caches them so that when you visit a webpage a second time,
you don't have to download that stuff again.

Good frameworks will often rewrite the names of your assets to add a content-based "fingerprint" to the filename to help browsers know
if they've already cached some version of a file. If you change the file in any way, it gets a new fingerprint to let the browser know
that it's a different file.

<Aside>
    <h2 slot="header">For example:</h2>
    <slot>
    Imagine that we have this simple JS file served by our app:
    ```js
    // time.js
    export function getTime() { return new Date() }
    ```

    Most frameworks will give this file a fingerprinted name. Sprockets (the asset pipeline for Rails), will assign this file the name:
    ```
    time-e96f2a9555d6e40450555a1c2a52da3c59175e85043a59c3f2568a0f35770e51.js
         ^ -------------- this is the fingerprint ----------------------^
    ```

    Let's say I get bored with the `function` keyword:
    ```js
    // time.js
    export const getTime = () => new Date();
    ```

    Guess what? Now it has a new fingerprint:
    ```
    time-42c814022932fa83186babe7c496f82947d17c415aaa8bbc31b469b91ebdc5cb.js
    ```
    </slot>
</Aside>

In the above example, my change of heart with respect to the `function` keyword only invalidated 47 bytes of JS. If this had been part of a large bundle including other modules and dependencies, it might have invalidated hundreds of kilobytes or more.

When you serve many small ES modules, the browser only needs to re-download those that have changed since it last saw your webpage.
Because you're very unlikely to touch every file every time you push a new update, you'll end up serving very little incremental JS to the browser.

### JS Parsing

We've talked a lot about downloading as a major performance factor for JS, but what the browser does once the JS is
downloaded can have a bigger drag on performance.

Once the browser finishes downloading your JS, it has to parse the JS and compile it to run efficiently in the browser before any of the code can be executed<Footnote text="Raj Rajhans: How JS code gets executed in the browser" href="https://rajrajhans.com/2021/06/how-js-code-runs-in-browser" />.
This can be a more expensive process than the download itself.

<figure>
  <Image
    src={scriptingWheel}
    width={732}
    height={404}
    format="webp"
    alt={"Time spent with a bundle of 437kb in size"}
  />
  <figcaption>Time spent executing a 437kb bundle on my M1 Max MBP</figcaption>
</figure>

The above figure demonstrates JS activity by category for a 437kb bundle from [factor.fyi](https://factor.fyi)<Footnote text="I'm picking on Factor because I helped build it" />.
The lion's share of time, **382ms** is due to "scripting"
which is any JS activity blocking the main thread. Of this, **119ms** is attributable to parsing and compiling.

Compare this with the download time of this bundle at just **75ms**.

If your page is heavily dependent on JS for client interactivity, having a large bundle can delay how long
it takes for your page to become interactive. Moreover, the ability of popular devices to efficiently parse and compile
JS varies wildly.<Footnote text="Addi Osmani: Javascript Startup Optimization" href="https://web.dev/optimizing-content-efficiency-javascript-startup-optimization/#parsecompile" />
Mobile devices, especially low-cost Android mobile phones, could expect to see parsing and compiling times 3-4x what you would get on higher-end hardware.

While using ES Modules isn't going to make parsing faster, it provides a built-in mechanism for code-splitting, helping reduce the
amount of unused JS on your page that the browser has to parse before your page can become interactive.

## My setup

I want to ~flex~ share my setup using Rails, esbuild, Typescript and Preact to get dead-simple ES Module support.

### Rails Sprockets + ImportMaps

I use Rails and Sprockets to build 99% of my web projects. I'll save why for another post, but I have a very simple setup
for building importmaps in Rails.

<CodeBlock

There are three main things I want to highlight above:
  1. `config/initializers/import_map.rb` contains a declaration of all the dependencies I want to be included in my importmap. Any remote dependencies are resolved using esm.sh with the version from `package.json`.
1. In my application layout, I added an `importmap` script in the `head` element which renders the JSON output of `ImportMap`.
1. The `ImportMap` class handles declaring the resolutions for external dependencies, as well as resolving local dependencies from Sprockets.

<Aside>
  <h2 slot="header">Why not use `importmap-rails`?</h2>
  <slot>
    Well, it famously does not, [nor will not](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/issues/124#issuecomment-1113969386), support Typescript. Luckily, it's not that hard to roll yourself using sprockets and esbuild.

### Typescript

I love Typescript, I use it whenever I can. I'll again save the long-winded extolling of values for another post.
One thing to note, however, is that all imports of local modules must be non-relative.
Using relative paths in your source code would force you to add a distinct importmap entry for every possible relative path to a module.
That would be very annoying to implement so a better approach is to just ensure that you're always using the same import declaration for a module that appears in your importmap.

Using non-relative paths requires some config changes in Typescript in order for the compiler to successfully type-check your code.

For example:
<CodeBlock
tabs={[
  {
    filename: "app/javascript/components/PriceLevel.tsx",
    language: "typescript",
    code: `
import type { VNode } from 'preact';

/**
 * 'utilities/dollarsigns' is a local module referenced
 * with a non-relative path.
 * We need to tell typescript how to resolve this non-relative path
 */
import dollarSigns from "utilities/dollarsigns";

export default function PriceLevel(props: { count: number }): VNode {
  return (
    <p>Price: {dollarSigns(count)}</p>
  );
}
    `
  },
  {
    filename: "tsconfig.json",
    language: "json",
    code: `
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    // paths helps typescript map a non-relative path to a relative one
    "paths": {
      "utilities/*": ["./app/javascript/utilities/*"],
    }
  },
}
    `
  },
  {
    filename: "import_map.json",
    language: "json",
    code: `
{
  "imports": {
    // ...
    "utilities/dollarsigns": "/assets/javascript/dollarsigns-abcd0123.js"
  }
}
    `
  }
  ]}
/>

### esbuild

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is great if you're like me and prefer very simple, straightforward tools. By those yardsticks, esbuild is fantastic: fast, predictable,
and requires limited configuration out of the box. It's also set up perfectly to transpile your code for ES Modules.

I have a pretty straightforward esbuild setup that globs all of my JS entrypoints and outputs them into a folder
where they can be picked up by Sprockets:

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
{
  language: "js",
  filename: "esbuild.mjs",
  code:`
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'
import { glob } from "glob";

(async () => {
  // Ignore all test files
  const ignore = {
    ignored: (p) => /^.*\.test\.tsx?$/.test(p.name),
  }

  let entryPoints = await glob("./app/javascript/**/*.*", {
    ignore
  });

  // also transpile any js associated with a ViewComponent
  entryPoints = entryPoints.concat(await glob("./app/components/**/*.ts", { ignore }));

  const buildContext = await esbuild.build({
    entryPoints,
    bundle: false,
    format: "esm", // 👈 this is the key config
    outdir: "app/assets/builds", // sprockets will pick up transpiled assets from here
    publicPath: "assets",
    loader: {
      ".svg": "dataurl",
    },
  });
})();
  `
}
]}/>

With this config, esbuild is doing _almost nothing_ to my source code. With my setup (Typescript and Preact), it's just
stripping types and transpiling JSX. If I weren't using either Typscript or Preact, I wouldn't need this step at all.

<details>
  <summary>Show me</summary>
  Here's a simple preact component from one of my projects:

  ```typescript
  // IconButton.tsx

  import cx from "clsx";
  import { VNode } from "preact";

  type Props = {
    class?: string;
    Icon: VNode;
    onClick: () => void;
  };

  export default function IconButton(props: Props): VNode {
    return (
      <button
        onClick={props.onClick}
        class={cx(
          "flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-full border border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm transition hover:border-slate-400 hover:shadow",
          props.class
        )}
      >
        {props.Icon}
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```

which will get transpiled to:

```js
import { jsx } from "preact/jsx-runtime";
import cx from "clsx";
function IconButton(props) {
  return /* @__PURE__ */ jsx(
    "button",
    {
      onClick: props.onClick,
      class: cx(
        "flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-full border border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm transition hover:border-slate-400 hover:shadow",
        props.class
      ),
      children: props.Icon
    }
  );
}
export {
  IconButton as default
};
```
</details>


### ES Module CDN: esm.sh

Using CDNs to deliver ES Modules to the browser has a bunch of advantages:

1. **No marginal server load**: don't waste your own CPU cycles delivering someone else's code.
1. **Reduced latency**: CDN edge nodes are typically going to be a lot closer to your users than your server is.
1. **No marginal cost**: They're totally free to use.

There are bunch of really great ES Module CDNs out there, but I use [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).
esm.sh has some really cool features, like the ability to alias dependencies to support things like [preact/compat](https://esm.sh/#docs), and
has generally been very solid for my needs.


## The net-net

Page performance actually matters, and not just because performance optimzation feels technically satisfying. Page performance
has real impacts on people and businesses.

Philosophically, life is short and it's kinda sad that we'll spend a nontrival
percentage of our lives just waiting for websites to load. Less philosophically, page performance has impacts on all businesses.
Better page speeds have impacts across SEO<Footnote text="Google blog: Speed is now a landing page factor for Google Search and Ads" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/search-ads-speed/"/>,
conversion<Footnote text="Elise Dopson: Website speed optimization" href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/site-performance-page-speed-ecommerce"/>,
and engagement<Footnote text="Pingdom blog: Does page load time really affect bounce rate?" href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/page-load-time-really-affect-bounce-rate/" />,
all of which can result in fewer customers and money when not optimized.

My point, simply, is this: don't shoot yourself in the foot. A modern stack with modern, simple tooling can deliver a
meaningful bump in pageload performance with very little lift on your part.
